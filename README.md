# Revolutionizing Dairy Farming: Predictive Analytics for Mastitis and Cattle Health with IoT-Driven Detectors and Boosted Milk Production
# This project presents an integrated approach for detecting and preventing mastitis in dairy cattle using a GPS-enabled and temperature-monitoring neck tag module. Designed for continuous health assessment, this system combines advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analysis to enhance cattle health management, reduce disease prevalence, and increase milk production.
